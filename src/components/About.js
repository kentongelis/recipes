            <p>Recipe Book is a React app project created my Dominican University
            of California student Kenton Gelis. This is the first React project that Kenton
            made. As a young adult, Kenton wants to learn how to cook so he decided to build
            this app to make it easier for himself and others who might want to learn how to 
            cook more recipes.</p>
